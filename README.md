# Sign-Up-Form

In this project for TOP I created a sign-up form. I used the new knowledge learned in CSS during the lessons for styling regarding: opacity, box-shadow, positioning, form styling , pseudo-classes etc. Also the form was created using the form element and its components as label, input and submit button.
